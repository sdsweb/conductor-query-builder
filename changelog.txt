Current Version: 1.0.6
==========================================


1.0.6 // May 20 2019
--------------------
- Introduce query tags
- Fixed a bug where adjusting query arguments in the advanced query builder did not properly trigger
  a preview query event in some cases
- Added logic to allow [FROM] parameter option elements to have configuration data via the "data-config"
  HTML5 attribute

1.0.5 // February 01 2019
-------------------------
- Added Conductor Gutenberg block

- Adjusted logic to check for the Conductor capability (using Conductor::$capability)
- Added Conductor_Query_Builder() instance as a new argument on the "conductor_query_builder_postmeta_form_limit" filter
- Fixed a bug where the maximum number of posts (Conductor Widget "max_num_posts" setting) was set to the posts per page
  option (which is the Conductor Widget default) when the query builder mode is set to "advanced" which resulted in
  incorrect pagination after the number posts per page was met
-- Note: To limit the maximum number of posts displayed when the query builder mode is set to "advanced", use the
   "Maximum Number of Posts" parameter in the "Limit" clause group

--------------------

  HTML attribute values instead of Conductor Widget defaults)
- Fixed a bug where FROM query argument action buttons were hidden in the shortcode query builder in some cases
- Fixed possible PHP notices that occurred when clause group data was expected to be an array but it was actually a string
- Fixed a possible fatal PHP error due to the removal of all widgets by Yoast SEO

- Added logic to utilize the "conductor-query-builder-skip-preview" attribute when attempting to preview a query
- Added logic to skip previewing a query if the shortcode query builder was active
- Adjusted _.debounce() timeout for previewing queries (changed from 300ms to 400ms)
- Added logic to abort the current query builder preview AJAX request when attempting a new preview of a query
- Added logic to remove the clause action buttons view from memory if it existed when removing the clause group view
- Added "conductor_query_builder_save_post_before" and "conductor_query_builder_save_post_after" actions
- Added "conductor_query_builder_preview_query_before" and "conductor_query_builder_preview_query_after" actions
- Added logic to determine the maximum number of pages (for pagination) on query builder queries
- Adjusted logic to convert simple query builder data to a single array to account for multidimensional array settings
- Adjusted Beaver Builder logic to account for Beaver Builder 2.0+
- Adjusted query builder "copy to clipboard" tooltip CSS
